### Lua

`scripting`
# Why you should learn Lua!
Lua is a great embedded system and game scripting language!

It is quite easy to learn and is very similar to Python!

It's very popular when making Roblox or Core games!

It's famous for being VERY underrated!

It only has about 22 Keywords too!

It's syntax

```
-- this is a comment
hello = "Hello World!" -- this is a variable
print(hello) -- this is a print statement

function printHello() -- this is a function
    print("Hello World!")
end

printHello() -- this is a function call

array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} -- this is an array table
-- Arrays start from 1, unlike other languages! (like Python)

dictionary = {
    ["key"] = "value",
    ["key2"] = "value2"
    } -- this is a dictionary table


for a,b in pairs(array) do
    print(a, b)
end -- this is a for loop

co = coroutine.create(function()
    print("Hello World!")
end) -- this is a coroutine
```
